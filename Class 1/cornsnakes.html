            Corn Snakes
          </h1>
          <p class="content-information">
            Taking its name from the corn granaries, which attracted mice and then mouse predators, the corn snake makes
            an excellent pet snake. It is generally docile, relatively easy to care for, and does not get very large;
            it's a great choice, especially for beginner snake owners. These reptiles are also favorites of even
            experienced keepers due to the array of beautiful colors and patterns that selective, captive breeding has
            produced. Closely related to rat snakes (as cousins in the genus Elaphe), corn snakes are sometimes called
            red rat snakes. They are native to the southeastern United States, mostly land-dwelling, and active mainly
            at dusk and dawn.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Corn Snake Behavior and Temperament
          </h2>
          <p class="content-information">
            These low-key snakes allow people to handle them and are generally docile. But when they feel threatened,
            especially in the wild, they may vibrate their tails as a defense mechanism, similar to rattlesnakes.
            <br><br>
            Like most snakes, corn and rat snakes are unrivaled escape artists. They will push at the lid with their
            noses looking for weaknesses and tiny openings, so the fit of the lid is very important. If a snake gets out
            of its cage it can get lost or hurt. An escaped snake is also likely to give your household visitors a good
            scare.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Housing the Corn Snake
          </h2>
          <p class="content-information">
            A 20-gallon long glass tank (a longer and shallower version of the standard 20-gallon tank) makes a
            good-sized enclosure for a corn snake. It is important to use a secure-fitting lid that can be clamped down
            from the top.
            <br><br>
            To feel safe, corn snakes need places to hide. Provide a hide box (any closed-in container like an
            upside-down cardboard box) that is just large enough for the snake to curl up in; if it is too large the
            snake will not feel as secure. Pieces of bark can also provide hiding spots for your snake if they are atop
            a substrate that allows burrowing under the bark. Ideally, there should be an available hiding place in both
            the cooler and warmer ends of the enclosure. Also, provide a forked branch for climbing.
          </p>

          <h2>Heat</h2>
          <p class="content-information">
            Maintaining your corn snake's home at the correct temperature is vital. An overhead incandescent heat lamp
            is the preferred method of heating, but corn snakes are from temperate climates, so they do not need
            tropical temperatures. Keep an ambient temperature of 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. A basking site should be
            85 to 88 degrees. At night, the temperature should drop only as low as 75 degrees. Under-tank heating pads
            or heat tape can be used, but they can make it difficult to monitor how hot the enclosure is, so use
            thermometers inside.
          </p>

          <h2>Humidity</h2>
          <p class="content-information">
            Luckily, corn snakes prefer the humidity found in a typical household. Between 35% and 60% is a good range
            for the ambient air in the enclosure: the higher end of this range will promote healthy shedding. Monitor
            your corn snake enclosure with a hygrometer, especially in the dryer winter months; you may need to mist the
            tank or refill an evaporating water bowl more frequently.
          </p>

          <h2>Substrate</h2>
          <p class="content-information">
            These snakes like to burrow and hide, so using a layer of loose substrate (floor lining) on the bottom of
            the enclosure is key. A variety of materials can be used as a bottom layer for the enclosure. Inkless
            newspaper is the utilitarian choice since it is very easy to clean up, but its appearance in the cage leaves
            a little to be desired. Indoor/outdoor carpeting (such as Astroturf) can be used, and if you cut two pieces,
            you can rotate them by swapping the clean one out for the dirty one at cleaning time; wash and thoroughly
            dry the soiled piece before using it.
            <br><br>
            For the top layer, aspen shavings can be used. The chips that are soiled with feces can simply be scooped
            out; clean and refresh shavings as needed. Move the snake to a separate container for feeding so that the
            shavings are not inadvertently ingested. Do not use pine or cedar shavings because the aromatic oils can
            cause irritation and respiratory issues in your reptile pet. Sand, soil, and corncob are also not good
            choices as substrates for corn snakes.
          </p>

          <h2>Food and Water</h2>
          <p>
            Corn snakes are carnivores. In the wild, they stalk their prey primarily via smell rather than sight.
            Captive corn snakes should be fed pre-killed frozen mice that are properly thawed. Hatchlings should start
            on pinkie mice for feedings, and the size of the prey should be increased as the snake grows. The prey item
            can be as wide or a little wider than the snake's head.
            <br><br>
            You should feed growing snakes twice per week; adults need only be fed one appropriately sized prey item
            every week or two. Your snake's appetite might decline around the time of a shed, so reduce feeding
            frequency if your snake is about to start shedding, evidenced by cloudy eyes and dulling of the skin color.
            <br><br>
            As corn snakes drink water by absorbing it through their mouths, a water dish is also necessary; it's
            important to keep the water meticulously clean. Snakes often use their water to aid them in defecation; when
            this happens, dump the dish, and clean and refill immediately. A heavy shallow dish several inches in
            diameter makes a good water source.
            <br><br>
            You may even find your snake soaking in the dish, particularly before a shed. Use non-chlorinated water
            whenever possible.
          </p>

          <h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems</h2>
          <p>
            Mouth rot, or infectious stomatitis, is a bacterial infection of the mouth that often causes saliva bubbles
            as well as inflammation in and around the mouth. If left untreated, this ailment can cause infection in the
            bone, and the snake's teeth may be lost. A toothless snake will not be able to eat correctly.
            <br><br>
            As with most snake breeds, corn snakes are susceptible to fungal disease and respiratory infections. Fungal
            infection is marked by discoloration of the skin. A sign of respiratory infection is open-mouth breathing or
            wheezing. All of these health issues require treatment by an exotic animal veterinarian who has expertise in
            reptiles.
          </p>

          <h2>Choosing Your Corn Snake</h2>
          <p>
            When choosing a snake, a captive-bred specimen is the best choice. One shouldn't be difficult to find since
            corn snakes breed fairly readily in captivity.
            <br><br>
            Look for a snake that doesn't have any retained skin from a shed. Choose a snake with clear eyes, no cuts or
            scrapes, and no mites or ticks.
            <br><br>
            Also, a clean cloacal vent, an alert head, and a mouth with a pink tongue and a small amount of clear saliva
            are all good signs of health.
